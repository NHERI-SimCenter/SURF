What is |appName|
---------------------------



Many environmental and geographical models, such as those used to understand and manage natural systems, and those used in climate studies, 
often rely on spatially distributed data as input that are known imperfectly and 
there is a lack of knowledge about the distribution pattern of the variable in a space.
Hence spatial uncertainty occurs. Uncertainty in the input data can propagate into model predictions. 

|appName| is a Python package for performing spatial uncertainty analysis using random fields and machine leaning. 
The user provides a spatially scattered dataset, |appName| learns the variation patterns in the dataset 
and predict values at locations where there are no observations.
Using random fields, the user can specify a correlation function to guide the simulation of uncertainty propagation.
Using neural networks, |appName| trains itself on the known dataset and predicts missing values based on the spatial patterns it found in the data.
